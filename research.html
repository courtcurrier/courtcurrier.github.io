      <p>
        My research focuses on the ecology of savannas and grasslands and how they 
        adapt to disturbances such as fire, grazing, and climate change. 
        The places I study are usually dry and already experience these disturbances, which define these systems! 
        But I study the effects of novel disturbance regimes, when ecosystems are pushed beyond historical magnitude or duration of disturbance events. 
        I am an empirical scientist, using long-term and large-scale field experiments combined with cutting-edge laboratory analyses.

      <h2>Current Projects</h2>
      <p>
        • Fire, grazing, and aridity controls on soil carbon storage and persistence<br>
        • Bigeochemical cycles and acclimation to global change drivers<br>
        • Soil microbial responses to disturbance, and mechanistic feedbacks to C and N cycling<br>
        • Grassland resilience across aridity gradients
