      <p>
        My research focuses on the ecology of savannas and grasslands and how they 
        adapt to disturbances such as fire, grazing, and climate change. 
        The places I study are usually dry and already experience these disturbances, which define these systems! 
        But I study the effects of <i>novel</i> disturbance regimes, when ecosystems are pushed beyond historical magnitude or duration of disturbance events. 
        I am an empirical scientist, using long-term and large-scale field experiments combined with cutting-edge laboratory analyses.

      <h2>Current Projects</h2>

<details>
  <summary>Fire, grazing, and aridity controls on soil carbon storage and persistence</summary>
  <p>
    We investigate how fire frequency, grazing intensity, and precipitation shape soil carbon storage 
    and long-term persistence in grassland ecosystems.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Biogeochemical cycles and acclimation to global change drivers</summary>
  <p>
    This project studies how nitrogen and carbon cycles adjust under novel climate and disturbance regimes.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Soil microbial responses to disturbance, and mechanistic feedbacks to C and N cycling</summary>
  <p>
    Examining how microbial biomass, community composition, and enzymatic activity respond to fire and grazing.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Grassland resilience across aridity gradients</summary>
  <p>
    We measure ecosystem recovery, plant composition, and productivity along gradients of dryness.
