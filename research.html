      <p>
        I am an ecosystem ecologist studying savannas and grasslands, with a focus on how these systems respond and adapt to disturbances such as fire, grazing, and climate change. 
        The sites where I work are typically dry and already shaped by these disturbances, which define the structure and function of these ecosystems. 
        I am particularly interested in the effects of <i>novel</i> disturbance regimes that exceed historical magnitudes or durations. 
        My research is empirical, combining long-term and large-scale field experiments with advanced laboratory analyses. 
        My goal is to understand the role of grassy ecosystems in mitigating climate change, particularly through their influence on carbon cycling. 
        I investigate both changes in carbon stocks and persistence, as well as the underlying mechanisms driving carbon fluxes, such as microbial activity and interactions with other nutrient cycles.

      <h2>Current Projects</h2>

<details>
  <summary>Disturance x climate controls on soil carbon storage and persistence</summary>
  <p>
    We investigate how fire frequency, grazing intensity, and precipitation shape soil carbon storage 
    and long-term persistence in grassland ecosystems.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Acclimation of biogeochemical cycles to global change</summary>
  <p>
    This project studies how nitrogen and carbon cycles adjust under novel climate and disturbance regimes.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Mechanistic microbial feedbacks to C and N cycling</summary>
  <p>
    Examining how microbial biomass, community composition, and enzymatic activity respond to fire and grazing.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Grassland resilience across aridity gradients</summary>
  <p>
    We measure ecosystem recovery, plant composition, and productivity along gradients of dryness.
